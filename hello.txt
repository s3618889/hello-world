Propose your app idea to the Lecturer for approval by posting your idea in the Course Forum. In your post, please explain how your app is FUN and USEFUL. Your app could havesome features similar to an existing app but it must have some unique features that others donâ€™t have. Note that you are NOT ALLOWED to take the source code from an existing app, change a little bit and submit. This will be considered as PLAGIARISM. All source code of your app must be written by you although the GUI and features could be inspired by others. App idea will be approved on the first-come-first-served manner. That means if you have the same idea with another team but you post later than them, you will have to change your idea. Therefore, please discuss about app ideas with your teammate and post your idea as soon as you agree with each other.
